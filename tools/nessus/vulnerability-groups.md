# Vulnerability Groups

The groups are built in the frontend, meaning there is no correlation between different SSL errors in the backend or database.

`nessus6.js` has a table containing all services:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png>)

When opening a scans details page, the JS loops over all findings/plugins and tries to match the service with the plugin name with the regex `(^|s)?<SERVICE>(s|$)?`:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1).png>)

This essentially just checks if the service name is part of the plugin name:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1).png>)

### Implementation

This is relevant for the SSL/TLS Findings block. The grouping can be mimicked by searching for the strings SSL and TLS in the plugin names.

```python
for plugin in plugins:
    if "SSL" in plugin.title or "TLS" in plugin.title:
        ...
```
